## About Rekrei

Rekrei (founded as Project Mosul, we changed our name in late 2015) is a volunteer project that crowdsources the digital reconstruction of lost heritage. The project was founded by Matthew Vincent and Chance Coughenour in March 2015. You can read more about the project on our [about page](https://rekrei.org/about)

## Core Team

Rekrei is a community of people who actively contribute towards the preservation of cultural heritage that has been lost through either natural means or human intervention. As a community effort, we believe in a community ownership. However, the project has a leadership component and final decisions are made by the core team. Currently, the core team is composed of the founders, if you are interested in becoming an active member of the core team, don't hesitate to contact us.

## Helping Out

Rekrei is all about community action. If you want to get involved, there are several ways to do so.

### Identify Locations

There are lots of reports about heritage being destroyed or lost around the globe. If you are aware of these locations, drop a pin on the map and that will help the community know where they can focus their own efforts.

### Upload Photos

Have you been to some of these places identified on the map? Do you have photos you've taken at those places? Why not donate them to the project, your photos could help cover missing angles in our digital reconstructions.

### Organise Photos

It takes time to figure out what photos belong together. Each location acts as a container for the photos, but we need more fine-grain control, and that comes when we can group the photographs together in relevant groups. Right now, the human eye is still the best way to do this. Anyone can look for photos that share similar elements, architecture, a monument, part of a wall, whatever it might be. There is no limit on how many groups a photograph can belong to, so go ahead and start grouping photos that you think belong together.

### Process Reconstructions

You don't have to be an expert to use photogrammetry software. We personally recommend using [nframes](http://nframes.com/), [3DF Zephyr](http://www.3dflow.net/), [MetaShape](http://www.agisoft.com/), or [Memento](https://memento.autodesk.com/about) by Autodesk. The last one is free, and should be fairly easy and intuitive to use. The first three require a bit more familiarity with how photogrammetry works, but won't take long to learn.

## Questions?

Please feel free to contact us directly at info@rekrei.org or through the [contact page](https://rekrei.org/contact) on the website.

## Contributing
Please read the [contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Setting up the application
In the root of the application, run:
```bash
bin/setup
```

And then go to http://rekrei.dev and you should find the application running. Hack away and have fun!

You can run the specs with:

```
bin/test
```
